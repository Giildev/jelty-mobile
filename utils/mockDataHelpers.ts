/**
 * Helper functions to work with mock data
 *
 * ⚠️ DEPRECATED - This file is being phased out
 *
 * These helpers were used with MEAL_DETAILS_MOCK and EXERCISE_DETAILS_MOCK.
 * Meal-related functionality has been replaced with real API calls.
 *
 * New code should:
 * - Use useMealDetail(id) hook which returns imageUrl directly
 * - Access meal.imageUrl from the ScheduledMeal objects
 *
 * Still in use for:
 * - Exercise helpers (getExerciseImageUrl) until workout API is implemented
 *
 * TODO: Remove after confirming all meal references are migrated
 * TODO: Migrate exercise helpers when workout API is ready
